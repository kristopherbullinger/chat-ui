Add your general design and decision comments here:

The repo came with redux installed as a dependency but the app was small enough that i
chose not to use it, and instead just passed state along component-to-component in the 
"traditional" manner. If it was much larger i would definitely connect the components
to the redux store, write some reducers, and map out actions for each component.

The repo that I forked has an outdated version of react and react-dom -- these versions
lack features that most react devs love now, including fragments and hooks! I had to
update both packages before starting my design.
